# Editor API

The editor's page (`editor.html`, design in `docs/editor.md`) exposes every command it has to
agents. The panels, the keyboard and the gizmo act through the same commands, so an agent can do
whatever a person can, and a person sees it happen and can undo it.

## Calling it

From an agent driving the page with a browser MCP, such as Claude in Chrome's `javascript_tool`
or the `evaluate` tool of Playwright's or Chrome DevTools' MCP servers:

```js
await solstice.call("scene.objects", { filter: "statue" })
// → { ok: true, result: { total: 1, objects: [{ id: "nohUSzZ9", name: "gothic_statue", ... }] } }
await solstice.call("object.move", { ids: ["nohUSzZ9"], by: [0, 0, 3] })
await solstice.call("history.undo")
solstice.help()                  // every command, its arguments as JSON Schema, and an example
solstice.help("object.move")     // one
solstice.list()                  // the names
solstice.version                 // 1, raised when a command changes
```

Every call returns `{ ok: true, result }` or `{ ok: false, error: { code, message } }`, and never
throws. Error codes are `unknown_command`, `bad_arguments` (a missing, misspelt or mistyped
argument, named in the message), `unknown_id`, `no_transform`, `nothing_selected`,
`nothing_to_frame`, `not_drawing` (a `pick` or `wait` while the tab is hidden, which draws no
frames: bring it to the front) and `failed`.

Changes an agent makes are steps in the same history as a person's, marked `agent` in
`history.list`, and undone the same way.

**WebMCP.** Where the browser offers `navigator.modelContext`
([WebMCP](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp)), the page also registers each command
as a tool with the same description and schema, its dots made underscores (`object_move`).

**What it can reach.** Only the scene open in that tab: no network, no files beyond the scene's
own project, and nothing given to it runs as code.

## Conventions

- Positions are metres, in the world: +Y is up, the sea lies towards +X in Cove.
- Rotations are degrees about X, Y and Z, applied as the bake applies them: yaw about Y, then
  pitch about the turned X, then roll about the turned Z. The camera's yaw and pitch are radians,
  as the viewer's are; yaw 0 looks along -Z.
- Entities are named by their id, which never changes. Names are for people and may repeat.
- A model seated on the ground (`on_ground` in `scene.objects`) shows the height the bake gave
  it. Moving it keeps that height, and drops its seat: the project then says the height.

## A session

```js
const { result: { objects: [statue] } } = await solstice.call("scene.objects", { filter: "gothic" });
await solstice.call("selection.set", { ids: [statue.id] });
await solstice.call("camera.frame", {});
await solstice.call("object.move", { ids: [statue.id], by: [0, 0, 3] });
await solstice.call("object.rotate", { ids: [statue.id], by: [0, 45, 0] });
await solstice.call("wait", { settled: true });
await solstice.call("stats.frame");          // fps, frame time, triangles, GPU errors...
await solstice.call("log.read", { level: "error" });
await solstice.call("history.undo");
```

## Commands

### `scene.info`

The scene's name, how many entities and instances it has, whether it can be saved, and the API's version.

No arguments.

### `scene.objects`

The scene's entities, parents before children: id, name, kind, parent, position, rotation (degrees), scale, and how many instances draw it. Paged.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filter` | string |  | Only those whose name or id holds this text (any case). |
| `kind` | string |  | Only this kind: mesh, actor, light, blocker, wood, clear, path, yard, pond or folder. |

```js
await solstice.call("scene.objects", {"filter":"statue"})
```

### `object.get`

One entity: everything scene.objects gives, its note, and its components as the project holds them.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | The entity's id, as scene.objects gives it. |

### `object.set`

Sets an entity's fields: position, rotation (degrees about X, Y, Z), scale, name, note, or hidden (in the editor only). One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | The entity's id, as scene.objects gives it. |
| `position` | [x, y, z] |  | Where it is, in metres. |
| `rotation` | [x, y, z] |  | Degrees about X, Y and Z: yaw about Y, then pitch, then roll. |
| `scale` | number |  | Uniform scale, above 0. |
| `name` | string |  | Its name in the outliner. |
| `note` | string |  | What it is for. |
| `hidden` | boolean |  | Hidden in the editor's viewport. Not saved. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.set", {"id":"a91fXq2b","position":[-7,0,2]})
```

### `object.move`

Moves entities by an offset, or to a position, in metres. One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] |  | The entities to change; the selection if left out. |
| `by` | [x, y, z] |  | How far to move, in metres along X, Y and Z. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.move", {"ids":["a91fXq2b"],"by":[0,0,2]})
```

### `object.rotate`

Turns entities: `by` degrees about the world's X, Y and Z axes (applied in that order), or `to` a rotation. One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] |  | The entities to change; the selection if left out. |
| `by` | [x, y, z] |  | Degrees to turn about the world's X, then Y, then Z axis. |
| `to` | [x, y, z] |  | The rotation to set: degrees about X, Y and Z, as object.set takes it. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.rotate", {"by":[0,90,0]})
```

### `object.scale`

Scales entities evenly: `by` a factor, or `to` a scale. One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] |  | The entities to change; the selection if left out. |
| `by` | number |  | A factor, above 0. |
| `to` | number |  | The scale to set, above 0. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.scale", {"by":1.5})
```

### `selection.get`

What is selected, as scene.objects describes it.

No arguments.

### `selection.set`

Selects entities by id (an empty list clears the selection), as clicking them does.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] | yes | The entities to select. |

```js
await solstice.call("selection.set", {"ids":["a91fXq2b"]})
```

### `camera.get`

The viewport's camera: position, yaw and pitch (radians; yaw 0 looks along -Z), field of view (degrees) and fly speed (m/s).

No arguments.

### `camera.set`

Moves the viewport's camera: a position, a yaw and pitch (radians), or a point to look at.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `position` | [x, y, z] |  | Where the camera is. |
| `yaw` | number |  | Radians about Y; 0 looks along -Z. |
| `pitch` | number |  | Radians above the horizon. |
| `look_at` | [x, y, z] |  | A point to face, instead of yaw and pitch. |
| `speed` | number |  | Fly speed, metres a second. |

```js
await solstice.call("camera.set", {"position":[40,6,20],"look_at":[0,2,0]})
```

### `camera.frame`

Moves the camera to see entities whole (the selection if no ids), as F does.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] |  | The entities to frame; the selection if left out. |

### `pick`

What is under a point of the viewport, given as fractions of its width and height from the top left: the entity (null for the land or sky), the instance and the point hit. Selects nothing.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x` | number | yes | 0 at the left edge, 1 at the right. |
| `y` | number | yes | 0 at the top, 1 at the bottom. |

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `time` | number |  | Hours, 0 to 24. |

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `since` | number |  | Only entries numbered above this. |
| `level` | string |  | Only info, warn or error. |
