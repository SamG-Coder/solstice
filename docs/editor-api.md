# Editor API

The editor's page (`editor.html`, design in `docs/editor.md`) exposes every command it has to
agents. The panels, the keyboard and the gizmo act through the same commands, so an agent can do
whatever a person can, and a person sees it happen and can undo it.

## Calling it

From an agent driving the page with a browser MCP, such as Claude in Chrome's `javascript_tool`
or the `evaluate` tool of Playwright's or Chrome DevTools' MCP servers:

```js
await solstice.call("scene.objects", { filter: "statue" })
// → { ok: true, result: { total: 1, objects: [{ id: "nohUSzZ9", name: "gothic_statue", ... }] } }
await solstice.call("object.move", { ids: ["nohUSzZ9"], by: [0, 0, 3] })
await solstice.call("history.undo")
solstice.help()                  // every command, its arguments as JSON Schema, and an example
solstice.help("object.move")     // one
solstice.list()                  // the names
solstice.version                 // 1, raised when a command changes
```

Every call returns `{ ok: true, result }` or `{ ok: false, error: { code, message } }`, and never
throws. Error codes are `unknown_command`, `bad_arguments` (a missing, misspelt or mistyped
argument, named in the message), `unknown_id`, `no_transform`, `nothing_selected`,
`nothing_to_frame`, `not_a_project`, `not_removable`, `bake_failed`, `not_drawing` (a `pick` or `wait` while the tab is hidden, which draws no
frames: bring it to the front) and `failed`.

Changes an agent makes are steps in the same history as a person's, marked `agent` in
`history.list`, and undone the same way.

**WebMCP.** Where the browser offers `navigator.modelContext`
([WebMCP](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp)), the page also registers each command
as a tool with the same description and schema, its dots made underscores (`object_move`).

**What it can reach.** Only the scene open in that tab: no network, no files beyond the scene's
own project, and nothing given to it runs as code.

## Conventions

- Positions are metres, in the world: +Y is up, the sea lies towards +X in Cove.
- Rotations are degrees about X, Y and Z, applied as the bake applies them: yaw about Y, then
  pitch about the turned X, then roll about the turned Z. The camera's yaw and pitch are radians,
  as the viewer's are; yaw 0 looks along -Z.
- Entities are named by their id, which never changes. Names are for people and may repeat.
- A model seated on the ground (`on_ground` in `scene.objects`) shows the height the bake gave
  it. Moving it keeps that height, and drops its seat: the project then says the height.

## A session

```js
const { result: { objects: [statue] } } = await solstice.call("scene.objects", { filter: "gothic" });
await solstice.call("selection.set", { ids: [statue.id] });
await solstice.call("camera.frame", {});
await solstice.call("object.move", { ids: [statue.id], by: [0, 0, 3] });
await solstice.call("object.rotate", { ids: [statue.id], by: [0, 45, 0] });
await solstice.call("wait", { settled: true });
await solstice.call("stats.frame");          // fps, frame time, triangles, GPU errors...
await solstice.call("log.read", { level: "error" });
await solstice.call("history.undo");
```

Building a scene from blank terrain:

```js
await solstice.call("project.new", { name: "island" });   // baked in the browser in a few seconds
await solstice.call("scene.set", { terrain: { size: 256, cells: 128, height: 12, shore_x: 30 } });
await solstice.call("scene.set", { land: { sand: 18, dirt: 8 } });
await solstice.call("object.add", { kind: "wood", at: [-40, 0, -20] });
await solstice.call("scene.set", { meadow: 60 });
await solstice.call("env.set", { weather: "fair", time: 18.5 });  // saved with the scene
await solstice.call("bake.run");                          // waits for the bake, and shows it
await solstice.call("project.get");                       // the scene's file, to save or read
```

A new scene is kept in the browser as it changes (`editor.html?draft=NAME` opens it again), and
its bake in the browser gives the same file `bake --project` gives for it on a PC.

## Commands

### `scene.info`

The scene's name, how many entities and instances it has, whether it can be saved, and the API's version.

No arguments.

### `scene.objects`

No arguments.

### `stats.frame`

How the viewport is drawing: frames a second, milliseconds a frame, triangles, clusters, instances, geometry pages, megabytes fetched, GPU errors and any fallbacks for this GPU.

No arguments.

### `log.read`

The output log: the editor's messages, warnings and errors, each with a number; `since` gives only those after one.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `since` | number |  | Only entries numbered above this. |
| `level` | string |  | Only info, warn or error. |

### `wait`

Resolves after some frames have been drawn, or once streaming has settled, so stats and screenshots show a finished frame.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frames` | number |  | Frames to wait (default 2, at most 600). |
| `settled` | boolean |  | Wait until no geometry has arrived for half a second (at most 30 s). |

### `project.get`

The scene's project file as it would be saved, and whether it has changes not yet saved.

No arguments.

### `project.new`

Starts a new scene from blank terrain: an island of sand, dirt and grass in a coastal sea, baked in the browser and kept there as it changes. The scene shown now is left; save it first if it has changes.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string |  | Its name: letters, digits, - and _ (default untitled). |

```js
await solstice.call("project.new", {"name":"island"})
```

### `scene.settings`

The settings a scene has one of: its terrain, land bands, sea, texture size and starting camera, as the project holds them, with each field's range. Each is null if the scene has none.

No arguments.

### `scene.set`

Changes the scene's settings, each given whole, or null to take it away. One undo step. The scene bakes again in the browser; `bake.run` waits for it.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `terrain` | object or null |  | `{ size, cells, height, shore_x }`: metres across (16 to 4096), cells along a side (8 to 1024; more takes longer), hill height in metres, and the x where the shore begins (the sea lies towards +X). Null for no ground. |
| `land` | object or null |  | `{ sand, dirt }`: metres of sand from the water, then of dirt; grass beyond. Null for plain ground. |
| `sea` | object or null |  | `{ level, ocean }`: the calm sea's height, and a built-in ocean (`coastal`, `clear`, `ocean`, `murky`). Null for no sea. |
| `meadow` | number |  | Real grass on the grass, out to this many metres from the origin (1 to 4000); 0 for none. |

```js
await solstice.call("scene.set", {"terrain":{"size":256,"cells":128,"height":6,"shore_x":40}})
```

### `object.add`

Adds something the land is shaped by: a wood, clearing, pond, path or yard, where asked (at the middle of the view if not given), at its starting size. The scene bakes again; a pond shows at once. One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | yes | `wood`, `clear`, `pond`, `path` or `yard`. |
| `at` | [x, y, z] |  | Where, in metres; a pond, path or yard is laid round its x and z. |
| `name` | string |  | Its name in the outliner. |
| `fields` | object |  | Its own fields instead of the starting ones, as `object.shape` takes them. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.add", {"kind":"wood","at":[-40,0,-20],"fields":{"radius":25,"spacing":7}})
```

### `object.shape`

Changes a wood's, clearing's, pond's, path's or yard's own fields, given whole. The scene bakes again, but for a pond, which changes at once. One undo step.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | The entity's id. |
| `fields` | object | yes | wood `{ radius, spacing }` (spacing above 0.5 m), clear `{ radius }`, pond `{ min, max, level }` (corners as [x, z]), path `{ from, to, width }`, yard `{ from, to }`. |

```js
await solstice.call("object.shape", {"id":"wood-id","fields":{"radius":30,"spacing":6}})
```

A wood or clearing is moved like anything else, with `object.move`; the scene bakes again.

### `object.delete`

Removes woods, clearings, ponds, paths, yards or empty folders (the selection if no ids). The scene bakes again. One undo step. Models and actors can't be removed yet.

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string[] |  | The entities to remove; the selection if left out. |

### `bake.run`

Bakes the scene in the browser now, or waits for the bake already asked for, and shows it. Gives how long it took; a bake that fails is a `bake_failed` error with the bake's message.

No arguments.

### `bake.status`

Whether a bake is running or waiting to, and how the last one went.

No arguments.

### `gizmo.set`

The gizmo: its mode (move, rotate, scale), its space (world, local), and snapping (on, and its steps).

| Argument | Type | Needed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | string |  | move, rotate or scale. |
| `space` | string |  | world or local. |
| `snap` | boolean |  | Whether drags snap. |
| `move_step` | number |  | Metres a move snaps to. |
| `angle_step` | number |  | Degrees a turn snaps to. |
