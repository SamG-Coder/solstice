"""Unpacks Quaternius's Universal Animation Library (CC0) into target/ual, out of git.

The library is sold on a name-your-own-price page, so nothing can fetch it by URL. Get the two
Standard zips by hand, free if you like, and put them in one folder:

    https://quaternius.itch.io/universal-animation-library
    https://quaternius.itch.io/universal-animation-library-2

    python -I scripts/fetch-ual.py [--zips FOLDER] [--out target/ual]

Each zip is checked against its known digest first. Only the glTF clip files and the licences
come out: the rest is for other engines.
