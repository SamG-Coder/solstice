//! A coast's land in bands: sand along the water, a strip of dirt, then grass, with a meadow of
//! real grass on it and a wood beyond, as a scene file asks with `land`, `path`, `yard`,
//! `clear`, `meadow` and `wood` (see `scene_file.rs`).
//!
//! The bands follow how far inland a spot is from where the shore begins, so they keep to the
//! coast wherever it wanders, and each border meanders by its own noise, as a beach's edge and
//! a field's do. Paths and yards are dirt wherever they lie.
//!
//! Each border is where a smooth field crosses zero: how far past the sand's wandering edge a
//! spot lies, and how far past the dirt's or a path's. The terrain is one mesh whose texture
//! coordinates hold how much of each kind of ground there is at each point, sand and dirt, the
//! rest being grass, easing from one to the other over a metre or so either side of a border.
//! Its material blends the three textures there ([`Material::BLENDS`]), each laid by the
//! world's x and z, with what stands proud in each showing first, as grass grows through the
//! edge of a path and sand drifts into the hollows of turf.
//!
//! Grass patches fill the meadow. Where its edge is near, a patch is cut to the shape of the
//! grass there, from a few ragged shapes, and the grass dwindles towards its edge, so the
//! meadow ends as a frayed line, not a row of squares. Loose clumps stand on the turf beyond.
//! They sway in the wind. Trees and bushes are scattered by dart throwing over grass, clear of
//! paths, yards and the places the file keeps clear, and sway too.
