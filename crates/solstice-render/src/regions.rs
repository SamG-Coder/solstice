//! Scenes too big for one GPU binding.
//!
//! wgpu limits a storage binding to 2 GiB, which a scene of billions of triangles passes twice:
//! its cluster records, and the page pool it wants. So the cluster table is split in two, and the
//! pool in three by level of detail, close, middle and far, and spare ones that no page calls home, taking what the others can't. A pool of its own also means far
//! pages can't push out near ones that are wanted. A pool that has no room borrows what another
//! has free or isn't using.
//!
//! Only such a scene pays for any of this. The shaders are rewritten for it as text, so a scene
//! that fits compiles the source it always did, with the bindings and limits it always had.
//!
//! For an RTX 5080 on x64, natively or in Chrome: the one setup these scenes are for. Other devices
//! may work, and fail with a clear message if they offer too few storage buffers.
//!
//! A pool address holds its band in the top two bits, above the place within that band's buffer.
//! Adding a cluster's local offset to it needs no special care, and `counts` is left alone.
