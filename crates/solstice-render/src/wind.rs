//! The wind near the ground: one field that what sways, the water, rain and particles all read,
//! so that a gust crosses all of them in turn (`docs/weather-effects.md`).
//!
//! The weather gives the wind at cloud height. Near the ground it is about half that, and it
//! never blows quite steadily:
//! * its mean turns back and forth by some degrees and swells and slackens over tens of seconds;
//! * gusts and lulls tens of metres across, with rolls a few metres across within them, are
//!   carried downwind at the mean wind's speed, changing shape slowly as they go (Taylor's frozen
//!   turbulence). A gust is seen running across a meadow, then a pond;
//! * its direction wanders from place to place, more in turbulent air.
//!
//! [`WindSnapshot::velocity_at`] is the field itself, on the CPU. `common/wind.wgsl` is its twin
//! on the GPU, and `wind/field.wgsl` evaluates it each frame over a square around the camera, this
//! frame's and last frame's, into a texture that what sways reads (`common/sway_vertex.wgsl`).
