// Draws the rain: falling drops as streaks, the crowns of droplets they throw up where they
// strike, and drops falling from eaves (docs/weather-effects.md).
//
// Nothing is simulated. Every drop's place follows from a hash and the clock: the air carries
// a lattice of drops downwind with the mean wind, and each falls through it at its terminal
// speed, round and round a column of air around the camera. So rain costs only its drawing,
// and the same drop is in the same place however the camera moves. Three rings of such drops,
// coarser and fainter outward, fill the air out past a hundred metres. Drops end where the rain
// map says the first surface is, so none falls under a roof.
//
// A drop moving through one exposure is seen as a streak (Garg and Nayar 2006): it covers each
// pixel along its path for only the time it takes to cross it, so a streak is faint, and
// brightest against what is dark behind it. It shows the light around it, most of all the sun
// scattered onward through it, from the rain's light volume (rain/light.wgsl).
