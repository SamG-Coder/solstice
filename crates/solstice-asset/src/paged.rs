//! A scene divided for on-demand loading.
//!
//! A [`PagedScene`] is everything that stays resident: cluster records, the hierarchy, the
//! tables that say where the rest lives. Vertices and triangles live in fixed-capacity *pages*
//! that come and go. A page holds whole sibling sets, the clusters that share one parent
//! group, so swapping a set for its parents is all-or-nothing and can't open a crack.
//!
//! See `docs/streaming.md` for the rules that keep a partly loaded scene watertight.
