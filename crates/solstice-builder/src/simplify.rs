//! Quadric-error simplification by half-edge collapse.
//!
//! Half-edge collapses are used rather than optimal placement: every surviving
//! vertex is an original vertex, so the 16-bit position grid stays valid and no
//! new attributes have to be invented.
//!
//! Topology is tracked on welded *positions*, while attributes live on triangle
//! corners. A UV seam or hard edge is therefore not a topological boundary: the
//! surface collapses straight across it and each corner keeps a matching attribute.
//!
//! Flat surfaces have no geometric error to speak of, so shape alone would let them collapse
//! without limit, and report that nothing changed, while the texture across them slides and
//! smears. So each collapse also measures how far the texture moves, in world units, and that
//! counts towards both its cost and the reported error. The renderer then keeps finer clusters
//! until the movement is too small to see.
