//! What the player is doing, as named actions, and a recording of it, step by step.
//!
//! Keys, buttons and touches are mapped to actions before they reach the world (step 4 of
//! docs/gameplay.md). The world sees each action's value: 1 for a button held, 0 for released,
//! anything between for a stick or a trigger. It also sees which actions were pressed since the
//! step before, so a tap that comes and goes between two steps isn't lost.
//!
//! Gameplay reads the input of the step it is in, never of the frame, so a recording of each
//! step's input replays a run exactly. Where the game is watched from is part of it for the same
//! reason: a door that opens to whoever stands by it must open in the replay too. So is whether
//! the player has left whoever they play, to fly the camera.
